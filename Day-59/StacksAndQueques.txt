What is a Stack?
-> LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)
--> The last element added is the first one to come out.

Stack Operations : 
Push: Add an element to the top
Pop: Remove the top element
Peek/Top: View the top-most element

Examples
Stacks of Books
Undo/Redo feature
Recursion (Function Call Stack)
Browsing History


What is a Queue?
Queue follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle. The first element added is the first to be removed.

Queue Operations
Enqueue: Add an element to the end
Dequeue: Remove element from the front
Peek/Front: View the front-most element

Examples
Ticket Counter
OS Task Scheduling
Printers
Queues (in general)


Why Use Stack and Queue❓

Organize data logically (based on problem’s need).
Order of Operations Matter
Optimize time & memory for specific scenarios
Use Cases
Recursion (stack)
Level Order Traversal (queue)
BFS (queue)
DFS (stack)

# Summary : 

Stack vs Queue
Stack : 
Last-In-First-Out
Access only from top
Used in DFS, Recursion

Queue : 
First-In-First-Out
Access from front & rear
Used in BFS, Scheduling
